    <h1>Ei World's approach to Team Coaching</h1>

        <p>üí≠ Poor communication, anxiety, lack of trust and transparency, conflicts, tension ‚ùì</p>

        <p>Have you ever experienced this in your work environment? Are these situations familiar among team members within your company or were these occurring at some point? These are some of the most common problems team players face, preventing them from achieving their best potential and producing negative results. We all know that there is a strong connection between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction. </p>

        <p>Emotions can govern almost every aspect of our lives, from the whole journey of a customer leading to the acquisition of a product or service, to the CEO‚Äôs decision-making process that is part of his or her daily responsibilities. Experts at Ei World and their partners are aware of how emotional intelligence can influence these behaviors. They can also understand the importance of effective collaboration towards fostering the development of high-performance employees. To achieve this, we believe that team emotional intelligence is built with a set of norms and expectations that lead to a positive work environment, such as trust, safety, motivation and a sense of belonging. These norms are what is considered a ‚Äúteam‚Äôs culture‚Äù. </p>

        <p>As one of the solutions to make sure this culture is going in the right direction, Ei World offers what is called the ‚ÄúTeam EI Survey‚Äù. This is an innovative way to get team members to speak their minds about the issues they are facing, their current expectations, and it‚Äôs also a way to communicate how they feel, what changes they expect and what improvements are deemed necessary. It centers on acknowledging the current reality, identifying problems, recognizing predictable emotions and their relevance, and defining clear actions and behaviors to support continuous learning, improvement and adaptation. It is a fact that positive experiences bring positive outcomes‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>So, what are the results that you would like to see?</p>
